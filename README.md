# Capstone-II

**Week 21st-18th January**
During this week I have developed a machine learning model retrieving the data from a MATLAB data structure. This allowed me to access data from multiple subjects instead of a single dataset. I specifically focused on the forefoot_norm, midfoot_norm, and heel_norm for every speed and incline for every subject (these are the features for the model). In terms of the labels, this model had two: incline and speed. Incline is obtained by creating a new dictionary called "extracted_inclines" to store incline values that have been extracted from the original dictionary "sub_inclines". It then loops through the subjects in "sub_inclines" and for each subject, it creates a new dictionary in "extracted_inclines" to store the extracted incline values. On the other hand, speed is obtained by checking the key of a dictionary (step_key) and determining the speed based on whether it contains the strings "Slow", "Medium", or "Fast". Then the 3 features and speeed are added to a dictionary and then converted into a data frame (incline was originally its own dataframe but then 'incline_val' gets added to df2 containing 'time', 'heel', 'midfoot', 'forefoot', and 'speed'). This resulting dataframe was then preprocessed droping all NAs, and taking the average of the list of lists of GRFs for every incline and speed combination for every subject. Finally, the model, a Multioutput Random Forest Regressor,  was then trained and evaluated giving a mean squared error of 35.90814666399467 and a R2 score of -0.42560453628645456.The model was then saved, loaded and tested with new input.
